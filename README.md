<div>This is the first functioning website i've attempted to build!</div><div>I'm happy with the design, and how quickly I've been able to put this together while learning along side building it</div><div>This was built using HTML, CSS & JS. I think in the future, I would come back and completely redesign the site after learning a framework such as React, but until then, this is my Portfolio :)</div><div>Have a look around, and feel free to contact me if you would like to!</div>
